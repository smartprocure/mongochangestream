# 0.49.0

- Don't assume that `updateDescription` will be on the change stream event.

# 0.48.0

- Fixed bug where `processChangeStream` exits prematurely.
- Fixed bug when omitting an updated nested field.
- Omit fields from `updateDescription.removedFields` to prevent downstream issues.

# 0.47.0

- Bumped peer dependencies for `mongodb`.
- Reworked `safelyCheckNext`.

# 0.46.0

- Bumped peer dependencies for `ioredis` and `mongodb`.

# 0.45.0

- Added `uniqueId` option to allow the same collection to be synced in parallel.
- Deprecated option `shouldRemoveMetadata` in `detectSchemaChange`. Prefer `shouldRemoveUnusedFields`.

# 0.44.0

- Bump dependencies.

# 0.43.2

- Escape period in regex.

# 0.43.1

- Fix issue where omitting nested paths failed to remove the field from `updateDescription.updatedFields` do to dotted field name.

# 0.43.0

- Optionally pass an array of operation types (`insert`, `update`, ...) to `processChangeStream`.
  This allows you to skip operations you don't care about. For example, a `delete` operation
  due to a collection TTL index.

# 0.42.0

- NOTE: Breaking change!
- `processChangeStream` is now batched, meaning the callback now receives an array of
  change stream events.

# 0.41.0

- More robust error code handling for `missingOplogEntry`.

# 0.40.0

- Don't emit the `cursorError` event when stopping.

# 0.39.0

- Expose FSM via `state` property for `runInitialScan` and `processChangeStream`.

# 0.38.1

- Fix bug with fsm. Added accompanying test.

# 0.38.0

- Remove all health check code in favor of using the `cursorError` event.
- Simplify some code.
- Add support for sort order (asc, desc) on initial scan.

# 0.37.0

- Emit `cursorError` when an error occurs when calling `hasNext`. Useful for debugging
  syncing issues like a missing oplog entry caused by an inadequate oplog window.
- `missingOplogEntry` utility function.
- Change stream health check behavior has changed. The `healthCheck.field` option has been
  removed since determining a failed health check relies on a delayed check of a
  Redis key and not a MongoDB query.
- Type parameter on `initSync` to allow for extending the event emitter. Useful for downstream
  libraries like `mongo2mongo` and `mongo2elastic`.

# 0.36.0

- Optional `pipeline` for `runInitialScan`.

# 0.35.0

- Handle master failover scenario properly for initial scan.
- Emit `initialScanComplete` when initial scan is complete.

# 0.34.0

- Bump default `maxSyncDelay` to 5 minutes.

# 0.33.0

- Fixed cursor exhausted bug with initial scan.
- Simplified change stream cursor consumption.
- Resync flag via `detectResync`.
- Changed health check options for both initial scan and change stream.
- Change stream health checker requires a date field to determine if syncing has stopped.

# 0.32.0

- Better handling of state transitions.

# 0.31.0

- Explicit types for health check failure.
- Emit the following field to differentiate failure types:
  `failureType` with values `initialScan` and `changeStream`.

# 0.30.0

- Fixed bug preventing a previously completed initial scan from being stopped once restarted.
- Renamed `maintainHealth` to `enableHealthCheck`.
- Health check only emits now. You must call `restart` manually to reproduce the previous behavior.

# 0.29.0

- Make schema change event more specific - `change` is now `schemaChange`.

# 0.28.0

- Don't type event emitter so that it can be reused by downstream libraries like `mongo2crate` and `mongo2elastic`.

# 0.27.0

- BREAKING CHANGE: Moved emitter to top level.
- Emit event `healthCheckFail` if a health check fails.

# 0.26.1

- `Document` type should refer to type from `mongodb` not DOM.

# 0.26.0

- BREAKING CHANGE: `processChangeStream` now takes an option object instead of a pipeline for the second argument.
- Added `restart` fn to `runInitialScan` and `processChangeStream`.
- Added the following options to `runInitialScan` and `processChangeStream`: `maintainHealth` and `healthCheckInterval`. When `maintainHealth` is set to `true` a failure to write a record when performing an initial scan within `healthCheckInterval` will cause `runInitialScan` to restart. When `maintainHealth` is set to `true` a failure to process the latest insert within `healthCheckInterval` when processing a change stream will cause `processChangeStream` to restart.
- Use more generic `Record<string, any>` for type `JSONSchema`.

# 0.25.0

- Latest `prom-utils` that includes `batchBytes` option.

# 0.24.0

- Use `eventemitter3`.

# 0.23.0

- `JSONSchema` type.

# 0.22.0

- Option to strip metadata from a JSON schema for `detectSchemaChange`.
- You can now await `changeStream.start` which resolves after the initial
  change detection has completed.

# 0.21.0

- Ensure that you can call `start` after calling `stop`.

# 0.20.0

- Bump `mongodb` peer dep.

# 0.19.1

- Fix issue with `runInitialScan` where calling `stop` before the scan had finished
  would incorrectly set the scan completed key in Redis. Also, `stop` now awaits flushing
  the queue.

# 0.19.0

- BREAKING CHANGE: Changed API for `runInitialScan`. You must explicitly call `start` now.
  The change stream can be stopped by calling `stop`.
- It is now possible to cleanly stop `runInitialScan` and `processChangeStream`, allowing
  for a smooth restarting behavior if a schema change is detected.

# 0.18.0

- Await processing of event when calling `stop`.

# 0.17.0

- BREAKING CHANGE: `initSync` now takes `collection`.
- NEW: `detectSchemaChange`.

# 0.16.0

- BREAKING CHANGE: Changed API for `processChangeStream`. You must explicitly call `start` now.
  The change stream can be stopped by calling `stop`.

# 0.15.0

- Export `getCollectionKey` util.

# 0.14.0

- Bump peer dependencies.

# 0.13.0

- Omit nested fields for `update` operations.

# 0.12.0

- Fix `Document` type.

# 0.11.0

- Prepend `pipeline` with omit pipeline if `omit` is passed to `initSync`.

# 0.10.0

- Renamed `Options` to `SyncOptions`.

# 0.9.0

- Moved `omit` to `initSync` so that it can be used in the `processChangeStream` pipeline.

# 0.8.0

- Don't delete the last scan id key when initial scan is completed.
- Allow an initial scan to resume after completion by calling `clearCompletedOn` first.
- Export `getKeys` fn.
- Changed Redis key prefix from to `mongoChangeStream`.

# 0.7.0

- `omit` option for excluding undesired fields.

# 0.6.0

- `sortField` option for overriding the default sorting field of `_id`.

# 0.5.0

- Pass `QueueOptions` to `runInitialScan`.

# 0.4.0

- Bumped `prom-utils` to latest.

# 0.3.0

- Batch `runInitialScan`.

# 0.2.0

- Separate out event stream handling into the `processChangeStream` method.

# 0.1.0

- Initial release.
